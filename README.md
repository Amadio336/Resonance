# Resonance

**Main Aim**

A web application that aims to find, analyze and handle dialogic syntax in ancient Greek texts

**Operation detail**

The app is based on three phases:
- **First phase or input phase**: user provides the row text to the app, it deals with cleaning the text given, deleting punctuation, paragraph signs and everything that isn't pure Greek
- **Second phase or selection phase**: once the text is obtained and cleaned, app provides some tools to analyze the possible presence of dialogic syntax. once words are selected, the last thing that remains is to construct a diagraph with them
- **Third phase** or construction phase:  user can finally create its diagraph by dragging and dropping elements


You can try a **demo** of Resonance on this **https://resonance-ancientgreek.netlify.app/**.
